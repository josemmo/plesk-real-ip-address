Get the real IP Address of your visitors when running your server behind a CDN, load balancer or proxy.

### As easy as ticking one checkbox

When running your Plesk server behind a proxy, such as a load balancer or a CDN, both access and error logs will not store the actual IP address of your visitors. Instead, the IP addresses of the provider you're using will get logged.

To fix this issue, install the extension, choose between multiple already defined CDN presets and click on "Apply". That's it! No reboot required.

### Features

- Presets for Cloudflare, CloudFront and Fastly
- Automatic upgrades of IP ranges for presets
- Add custom IP ranges and modify the header field containing the visitor's IP address
